    "\n",
    "Pyro has been designed with particular attention paid to supporting stochastic variation inference as a general pupose inference algorithm. Let's see how we go about doing variotional inference in Pyro. \n",

    "# Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We're goint ot assume we've already defined our model in Pyro (for model details on how this is done... see previous work)n As a quick reminder, the model is given as a stochastic function `model(*args, *kwarg)`, which, in general case takes arguments. The different peices of `model()` are encoded via the mapping: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Observations <--> `pyro.sample` with the `obs` arguments\n",
    "2) latent random variables <--> `pyro.sample`\n",
    "3) parameters <--> `pyro.param` \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's establish some notation. The model has observation **x** and latent random variables **z** as well as parameters **theta**. It has a joint probability density of the form... \n",
    "\n",
    "P_theta(x,z) = P_theta(x|z)*P_theta(z)\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the various probaility distributions p_i that make up P_theta(x,z) have the following properties: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) we can sample from each p_i \n",
    "2) we can compute pointwise log pdf p_i \n",
    "3) p_i is differnetiable w.r.t. the parameters theta\n",

    "# Model Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "In this context our criterion for learning a good model will be maximizing the lgo evidence, i.e want to find the value of **theta** given by \n",

    "theta_max = argmax_theat (log*p_theta(x))\n",
